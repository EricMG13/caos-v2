# Rebuild plan

Eleven phases (0–10). Each has an exit test — a named, runnable check that fails
before the phase and passes after. A phase is not done because the code exists;
it is done when its exit test passes and the prior phases' tests still pass.

Order is chosen so the thing most likely to be wrong is built earliest, when it
is cheapest to change. The predecessor reached 29k lines of server code before
anyone noticed its route resolution read the wrong table.

---

## Phase 0 — Repository and gates

Before any application code. The controls in `docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md` must
exist before the code they govern.

- `pyproject.toml` with hashed, fully pinned locks; `Makefile`;
  `.claude/settings.json` with the format and guard hooks.
- CI: `lint · types · test · security · size`. `image` waits for the Dockerfile
  (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §11). Pre-commit with ruff, gitleaks, the vocabulary
  check.
- SonarQube Cloud bound to the repository (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §15): automatic
  analysis until Phase 1 lands code and a coverage report, then the `sonarqube`
  CI job.
- `scripts/check_vocabulary.py`, `scripts/check_tested.py`, `scripts/tracked.py`,
  `scripts/io_budget.py`, `scripts/scan_floors.py`.

**Exit:** an empty PR that adds one unformatted, unnamed, untested function is
refused by CI for all four reasons separately.

## Phase 1 — Store, events, boundary text

- Postgres schema in full at startup. Blob store, content-addressed.
- `run_events` with per-run monotonic `seq` under the run row lock.
- Transactional pairing: state + event, on a conditional update.
- `BoundaryText`; typed refusal codes with no vendor or filesystem detail.

**Exit:** `test_terminal_event_is_exactly_once` — a simulated crash in the
commit gap yields one artifact, one charge, one terminal event.
`test_boundary_text_rejects_bidi_override`.

## Phase 2 — Ingestion, tokens, evidence

- Admit a pack or refuse it, in one transaction. Extract text with page and
  rectangle per token into `source_tokens`. Pack `source_blocks` keyed by
  `(source_id, block_id)`.
- Source-set versioning under the case row lock.
- `read_evidence`: validated at the boundary, fails closed, returns no text on
  refusal.
- Citation anchoring: re-locate `matched_text` at the stated page, derive the
  rectangle, refuse what cannot be located.

**Exit:** `test_evidence_refusals_return_no_text` over the whole argument
surface; `test_uncitable_quote_is_refused_before_artifact`;
`test_io_budget_read_evidence` (the ~8× I/O failure mode — one read is one
row fetch, not a whole-source parse).

## Phase 3 — Route resolution

The phase the predecessor got wrong. Build it before anything depends on it.

- Read `profile["edges"]`. Implement `dependency_order`, `node_states`,
  `frontier`, `route_digest`. Readiness is read from the accepted CP-0
  artifact, never passed in (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §18).
- Soft edges harden when the source is READY.
- Research and model route extensions, host-declared, no catalog edit.
- `resolve_route` pure; `pin_route` at the gate.

**Exit:** `test_optional_edge_does_not_block`,
`test_optional_edge_blocks_when_source_ready`,
`test_qa_gate_blocks_cp6_until_cp5_accepted`,
`test_restricted_node_runs_and_carries_limitation`,
`test_resolved_route_is_pinned_and_replays_identically`,
`test_cp_cf_waits_for_all_required_owners`,
`test_model_extension_refuses_missing_owner`.

## Phase 4 — The frontier loop

- `while frontier(...)`: run ready nodes concurrently, one attempt row per try.
- Recovery is recomputation from accepted attempts. No checkpointer.
- Budget reservation before any provider call; reconciliation after.

**Exit:** `test_recovery_is_recomputation` — kill mid-run, restart, the run
completes without restarting completed nodes and without a checkpoint file.
Plus the three the provider-call contract owes (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §21):
`test_crash_after_remote_completion_keeps_its_reservation`,
`test_a_retry_without_provider_idempotency_reserves_again` and
`test_concurrent_reservations_at_the_ceiling_refuse`.

## Phase 5 — Methodology boundary and one module end to end

- Bundle verification on the bytes at use; `assemble_authority` **without**
  SKILL.md slicing; per-module `authority_digest`.
- Registry with `_CARVE_OUTS`, the host's one declaration: CP-PARSE and its
  wiring test (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §24).
- Calculator execution boundary with host-owned selection and work factors.
- CP-1 running against a real provider, producing a canonical envelope.

**Exit:** `test_authority_bytes_mismatch_refuses`;
`test_cp1_produces_canonical_envelope_with_anchored_citations`.

## Phase 6 — Gates and the run surface

- Digest-bound interrupts: source-set pinning, research-plan approval.
- Acceptance as a CAS transaction.
- SSE tail with `Last-Event-ID`; membership rechecked per event.
- The run endpoint serves node states with their reasons, and the one QA_GATE
  reads as a gate; `/run/` draws it in Phase 9.
- Commit-time authority on the store call that releases a gate: `case_members`,
  and standing rechecked inside `approve_plan`, not only at the request.

**Owed by exited phases**, and exited here (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §38):

- Withdrawal, the second half of invariant 1: a `withdrawn_at` on `sources`,
  refused by `read_evidence` at every use and re-opening the plan gate —
  `test_a_withdrawn_source_refuses_the_read_and_reopens_the_gate`.
- Extraction (Phase 2): a real PDF fixture through a real extractor, tokens
  carrying region and line — `test_citations_anchor_in_an_extracted_pdf`.
- The loop meets `execute_module` and charges what the provider reported
  (Phase 4) — `test_the_loop_charges_what_the_provider_reported`.
- One live run of `test_the_live_provider_returns_a_completion` (Phase 5), its
  `request_id` recorded in a decision entry.
- `audit_events` and `audit_chain_heads` (Phase 1): a governed write commits
  its audit event or nothing —
  `test_a_governed_write_commits_its_audit_event_or_nothing`.

**Exit:** `test_approval_binds_the_exact_reviewed_content`;
`test_membership_revocation_refuses_commit`;
`test_sse_closes_after_terminal_delivery`; and the five owed above.

## Phase 7 — The forecast and the image

The workbook build that stood here went with CP-MODEL (`docs/DECISIONS.md`
§48). What remains is the arithmetic the host owns and the image it ships in.

- `cash_flow_forecast` calculator and CP-CF (`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §6.1–6.2).
- The model extension appends CP-CF alone: `MODEL_EXTENSION` drops CP-MODEL
  and the two tests that placed it, in this slice.
- The Dockerfile — one process, standard-library calculators, no LibreOffice —
  and the `image` job with its scan floor (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §11).

**Exit:** `test_forecast_complete_requires_every_requested_period` refuses a
missing, duplicate, extra or unavailable case-period; a full horizon with an
explicitly unavailable zero-denominator ratio remains valid. An independently
wrong residual and forward propagation are exercised by
`test_forecast_residual_is_not_forced_to_zero` and
`test_forecast_unavailability_propagates`.
`test_the_extension_appends_cp_cf_alone` pins the route the plan gate digests.

## Phase 8 — The deliverable and its filing

- The deliverable, rendered by the host from the frozen snapshot: the accepted
  artifacts in route order, every figure with its citation, one HTML file that
  prints to paper and is never overwritten (`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §7;
  `docs/DECISIONS.md` §48).
- Opinion on the exact revision; freeze; filing refusing the signer and the
  freezer; detached receipt; the verifiable package over the audit chain
  Phase 6 started.

**Exit:** `test_the_deliverable_renders_from_the_frozen_payload_alone` — the
same frozen payload renders byte-identically with the store closed;
`test_filing_refuses_the_opinion_signer`;
`test_audit_package_verifies_with_stdlib_alone`.

## Phase 9 — The workspace

`docs/IA_SPEC.md` in full. Nine sections, one word each, static export.

- The four chrome bands on every section; the nine-section rail with counts and
  one-line state; served role read-only beside it.
- Analysis, Book (metric passport, ten fields), Model (the projection with the
  residual column), Committee (the deliverable and its filing).
- Every decision state rendered distinctly.

**Exit:** `npm run a11y` and `npm run test:workbench` green on three engines;
`test_passport_contract` asserts all ten fields on an actual and on a projected
cell.
`test_book_binds_one_snapshot_per_compared_case` compares two issuers and
refuses a late response carrying a different snapshot for either one.

## Phase 10 — Qualification

Corrected in place per §12's process rule: this phase was written around a
*corpus*, which `CONTEXT.md` bans as a synonym for **source set** and
`scripts/check_vocabulary.py` refuses on an identifier — the exit test below
could not have been written under its original name. The body a verdict is
measured against is a **qualification set**, a term `CONTEXT.md` now carries
(`docs/DECISIONS.md` §23).

- The qualification-set harness, the answer keys, the matrix.
- A verdict is bound to provider identity, qualification-set digest, build,
  date, expiry and reviewer.

Two words, defined here because nothing else defines them. `ORCHESTRATION_PROOF`
is what the host can assert on its own: the pinned methodology ran as pinned,
against the pinned sources, and every citation re-located. `QUALIFIED` is a
reviewer's signature that the outputs met the answer keys, and it remains an
external input until the credential and the analyst approvals exist.

**Exit:**
`test_a_verdict_binds_provider_qualification_set_build_date_expiry_and_reviewer`
refuses a verdict missing any of the six or past its expiry;
`test_a_host_control_reads_orchestration_proof_never_qualified` — no code path
in this repository can mint `QUALIFIED`.

---

## Standing rules across all phases

- Test first. The failing test names the invariant.
- One concern per PR.
- A new limitation gets a `CLAUDE.md` known-gaps entry in the same PR that
  creates it.
- No new dependency without a dated `DECISIONS.md` entry.
- Never edit an upstream bundle file.
- Authority is checked where the commit is. The phase that first commits a
  human decision ships the standing check inside the store call
  (`test_membership_revocation_refuses_commit`, Phase 6); the first phase
  exposing an HTTP route ships identity derivation and the actor matrix for
  that route (`test_production_never_trusts_role_header`,
  `test_unauthorised_case_is_private_404`). `SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §8 says commit
  time, and a check at the request is not that.
- A phase is exited by its named tests, and
  `test_every_exit_test_of_an_exited_phase_exists` refuses a later phase
  starting before they are written. A deliverable an exited phase did not ship
  is owed by the current phase, listed under it with the test it owes — never
  added back to the exited phase.
- When a decision entry overrides this plan or a spec, the overridden text is
  corrected in place and cites the entry (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §38). A reader
  must not have to know which of thirty entries rewrote the page in front of
  them.

## What is deliberately not in the plan

A checkpointer. A second database. A message broker. An admin UI. Multi-instance
deployment. Each is a decision entry away if it earns its place; none is
scaffolded ahead of need.
