# Initialisation prompt

Paste this as the first message of a fresh session in a clone of this
repository. It is deliberately short: the contract lives in the repo, not in the
prompt. A long prompt that restates the docs will drift from them.

```
You are building CAOS v2 from a complete specification and no application code.
The record is docs/DECISIONS.md: §12 says where this repository came from, §14
what it does not build, §16 which provider it calls.

Read first, in this order, in full:
  CLAUDE.md, CONTEXT.md, docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md, docs/SYSTEM_SPEC.md,
  docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md
Then, when the phase reaches them: docs/IA_SPEC.md, docs/MODEL_BUILDER_SPEC.md,
DESIGN.md.

The methodology bundle is vendored, read-only, and authoritative. Never edit a
file that exists upstream; additions go in new skill folders.

Work one phase at a time from docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md, starting at the lowest
phase whose exit test does not pass. For each phase:

  1. State which phase you are on and what its exit test asserts.
  2. Write the failing test first. Run it. Show me it failing for the right
     reason — a test that fails because of a typo proves nothing.
  3. Implement the smallest thing that makes it pass.
  4. Run the confidence-review skill, then the rewrite-tournament skill on any
     non-trivial function you wrote.
  5. Run `make check`. Open a PR with one concern in it.
  6. Stop and report. Do not begin the next phase without me.

Non-negotiable while you work:
  - Test first. The failing test names the invariant it protects.
  - Decimal on every money path. Never float.
  - Typed refusals only. No bare except, no str(exc) in a log or a response.
  - Never log document-derived text.
  - No new dependency without a dated docs/DECISIONS.md entry.
  - Any accepted limitation gets a CLAUDE.md known-gaps entry in the same PR
    that creates it.
  - A scanner that scanned nothing is a failure, not a pass.

If the spec is wrong, say so and stop. Do not build around it, and do not
weaken an invariant to make a test pass. The specs are the product of a long
review; they are also fallible, and a contradiction you found is more valuable
than code you wrote.

Begin at the lowest phase whose exit test does not pass.
```

## Why it is shaped this way

**"Show me it failing for the right reason."** The measured +75 % logic-error
rate in agent-written code is not fixed by having tests; it is fixed by tests
that were seen to fail. A test written after the implementation tends to assert
what the code does.

**"One concern in it."** AI PRs carry ~1.7× the issues of human PRs, and issue
density rises with diff size. The cap is the cheapest control available.

**"Stop and report."** Ten phases executed without a checkpoint is one long
uninterrupted opportunity to drift from the spec.

**"If the spec is wrong, say so and stop."** The predecessor's most expensive
defect — route resolution reading the untyped display list instead of the typed
edges — was in the code for months behind a green suite. An agent that builds
around a contradiction hides exactly that class of problem.

**No restatement of the invariants.** They are in `CLAUDE.md`, which the prompt
requires reading in full. Restating them here creates two versions that will
disagree.

## Session hygiene

- One phase per session where practical. Context that has watched three phases
  land is context that half-remembers the first.
- Re-read `CLAUDE.md` at the start of any session that resumes mid-phase.
- The plan's exit tests are the only definition of done. "It works when I try
  it" is not an exit test.
