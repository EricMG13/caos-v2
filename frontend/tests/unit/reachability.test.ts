// Admin is unavailable in every mode (`src/app/sections.ts`), and on

// `tests/workbench/chrome.spec.ts` asserts rather than keep implementations
// nothing mounts. Their legacy wire types went with them. The walk above
// cannot see this on its own: an `import type` is erased, so a retired wire
// module is unreachable and still shipped as a file, and a reduction that left
// one importer behind would compile clean. This is what says the deletion was
// complete rather than merely compiling.
// Both spellings of each: `src/wire/index.ts` reached its two by a relative
// specifier, so a list of `@/` paths alone would have read clean over two live
// importers. No other `book` or `admin` wire module exists under `src/`.
// `@/app/ledger` left this list in Task 12.3, which served the Book a v1
// document and gave the snapshot ledger its caller back.
