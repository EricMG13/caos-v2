// The control renders from the document's own `chrome.actions` -- present
// and refused, never hidden (decision 10; CLAUDE.md "Persona is not
// authority") -- and the command rechecks authority at commit regardless of
// what this control shows. An action this section's document does not name
// at all is not available either: `RefusedControl`'s own fallback
// (`ACTION_UNPLACED`) is what renders it that way, by this control passing
// no `onClick` when there is no `action` to check. On success this section
// refetches its own document once; 4.4 owns the SSE-driven refresh other
// sections get. A refetch that fails never reads as nothing happened: the
// success stands (the case exists) beside a distinct, visible refresh
// failure.
