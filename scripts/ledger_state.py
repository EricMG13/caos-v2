"""Read the known-gaps ledger in CLAUDE.md as structured entries.

The ledger is the contract's honest record of accepted limitations, and it rots
in one direction: an entry stays open after the work that closed it has landed,
so a reader is warned about a gap the tree no longer has. `CLAUDE.md` already
says an entry describing a gap the tree has since closed "is the same defect as
a missing one, read the other way round" -- this module is what lets a test say
so mechanically instead of trusting a reviewer to notice.

It parses and judges nothing. `tests/test_ledger.py` holds the rules, because
which entries may be open is repository policy rather than a property of the
text. `--report` prints what this reader sees, which is how a person checks the
parser itself rather than the ledger.
