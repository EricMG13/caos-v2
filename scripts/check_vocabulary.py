"""Refuse an identifier that spells a CONTEXT.md term by one of its synonyms.

Naming inconsistency is ~2x more frequent in agent-written code
(docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md section 1). CONTEXT.md is the single glossary; this
check is what makes it binding on code rather than on intention.

Only identifiers are examined -- never prose, never string literals -- because
the defect being prevented is two spellings of one concept minting two lineages.
