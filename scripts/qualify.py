"""Perform an on-disk qualification set against the configured live provider.

The three qualification runs this repository has paid for were driven by a
script that lived in a temporary directory. Two of them nearly lost their
evidence with it, and the third could not be reproduced without rewriting the
driver from the handoff. A run that costs money and can be run once is exactly
the thing that should not be reconstructed from memory, so the driver lives
here, under the same gates as everything else it calls.

It creates a database and a blob root of its own, so a performed set can be
kept for re-checking without touching a developer's own store, and it prints
where both are. Configuration is the caller's environment and nothing else:
`OPENROUTER_*` for the provider (§16), `CAOS_MODEL_PRICE` for the dated price
the reservation is computed from, and `CAOS_TEST_POSTGRES_URL` for the server
to create the run database on.

    scripts/qualify.py qualification/vmo2-fy2025 \
        --expect-identity openrouter/openai/flex/high/65536 --ceiling 22.00

`--expect-identity` is not a convenience. A verdict binds the execution profile
it was measured under, so the run refuses before spending anything if the
environment resolves to a different one than the caller believes.
