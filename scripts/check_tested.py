"""Refuse a public function or class that no test names.

Logic and correctness errors are ~75% more frequent in agent-written code
(docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md section 1), and the control is a test that was watched
to fail. This gate cannot see whether a test was written first; it can and does
refuse the case where no test mentions the symbol at all.

Scope is module-level definitions. Methods are covered through the class that
holds them -- see the known-gaps ledger in CLAUDE.md.

The axis is a *reference*, not a mention. This gate used to search every byte
of the suite for the symbol's name, and on 17 September 2026 that passed
`canonical._within_reservation` -- the guard that stops a rebuilt prompt going
out under too small a reservation, which is invariant 8's whole claim on that
path -- with no test driving it, because the name appeared in a **comment** in
`server/engine/runtime.py`. A sentence about the code satisfied the check for
the code. Names are resolved through the AST now, so a comment, a docstring and
a prose string satisfy nothing.

What is still admitted from a string is a dotted identifier path, because
`monkeypatch.setattr("server.store.runs.append", ...)` is a real reference and
Python gives it no other spelling. A path is `a.b.c` and prose is not, so the
axis holds.
