"""Emit the release pack from the suite, the tree and, when asked, the store.

`docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Phase 13 (Task 13.6, O26): release evidence was a
signed check and a hand-kept record, not a pack, and `docs/feature-status.csv`
-- 248 dated rows, 14 of them citing tests the repair deleted -- is what a
hand-kept inventory becomes. This script is the regenerated answer that file's
ledger entry asked for. It writes two files and types neither:

- `release-pack.json`: the methodology build and manifest digest, the migration
  head (the same digest a migrated store records), the SHA-256 of every lock,
  the test inventory read from both suites, and one row per catalog pathway.
- `RELEASE_PACK.md`: the same facts for a reader, with the inventory reduced to
  its counts and digest.

Every pathway the vendored catalog advertises gets a row, and each row says one
of four things. `DISABLED`: not in `ADAPTER_ROUTES`, so the host refuses it
`HANDOFF_MODULE_UNSUPPORTED` before any attempt, whatever anyone signed.
`UNVERIFIED`: enabled, and no store was read, so nothing is claimed.
`NOT_QUALIFIED`: enabled, a store was read, and no current verdict stands
behind it. `QUALIFIED`: enabled, and a `qualification_verdicts` row -- signed
over complete evidence bound to this build, current at the `--as-of` moment the
caller names, and covering a run pinned to this pathway -- is in the store. The
host never originates that word (`server/qualification/verdict.py`); this
script only relays a row it can read back through `current_verdict`.

Reproducible by construction: sorted everywhere, no clock, no hostname, no git
state. A store read needs `--as-of` because a verdict's currency is a decision
taken at a moment, and a moment the script read off the clock would make two
emissions a second apart differ. The store is named by `CAOS_DATABASE_URL`
from the environment, never by an argument, so a credential never reaches a
process listing.
