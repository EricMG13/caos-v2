"""The one ASGI entry the image serves: the edge, the API and the static export.

Phase 4 Task 4.5, decision 7 (recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §53).

`application` is `EdgeGuard` outermost, so every response -- a static file, a
refusal, an API document -- carries the security headers and policy, and no
request reaches a file or a route before the edge has admitted it. Behind it:

- `/api` and `/api/*` go to `server.api.app:app`, lifespan included, so routing's
  own 404 and 405 there stay `ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND` and a file under the export
  never shadows an API path. The app installs `EdgeGuard` too; the scope marker
  the outer guard sets makes the inner one pass through.
- Every other path is a GET/HEAD-only read of `CAOS_SITE_ROOT`. `/` and each
  section's `/<section>/` (with or without its slash, with any query) serve the
  exported `index.html`, which routes on the client; anything else is a file
  under the root or 404. A directory is never listed, a path that normalises
  outside the root and a symlink resolving outside it are 404, and any other
  method is 405. Both carry no body.

The root is read from the environment on every use, like the edge's mode. With
it unset every non-API path is 404; set without an `index.html`, boot refuses
`EDGE_CONFIG_INVALID` before the app's own lifespan runs.
