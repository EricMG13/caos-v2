"""The edge guard: what a request must prove before anything else reads it.

Phase 4 Task 4.5, decisions 2 to 6 (recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` §53), and
Completion Phase 13 Task 13.4, which replaced the static shared secret with a
signed per-request assertion (§93).

**The edge contract.** The operator's edge authenticates with OIDC and forwards
only to a private API listener. It strips every inbound `x-caos-user`,
`x-forwarded-groups`, `x-caos-role` and `x-caos-edge-assertion`, every header
whose name contains `_`, and its own session cookie; it then sets exactly one
`x-caos-edge-assertion`, computed per request with `sign_assertion` below: an
HMAC-SHA256 under the deployment's key over the subject, the sorted groups,
the method, the raw target (path and query), the issued-at second and a
random nonce. It passes `origin`, `sec-fetch-*`, `idempotency-key`,
`last-event-id`, `content-type` and `content-length` through. Its session
cookie is `__Host-`-prefixed, `Secure; HttpOnly; SameSite=Lax`, and SSE is
unbuffered with an idle timeout above 300 s.

**Two modes, decided by the environment on every use.**

- *Edge mode* (`CAOS_EDGE_TOKEN` set -- the key): the key must be at least 32
  bytes, `CAOS_PUBLIC_ORIGIN` a bare `scheme://host[:port]`, and the
  development trust switch absent, or boot refuses `EDGE_CONFIG_INVALID` (and
  a request meeting such a configuration later is not trusted). Every request
  but `GET|HEAD /api/health` carries exactly one assertion that verifies under
  `hmac.compare_digest`, names this request's method and target, was issued
  within `ASSERTION_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` of now, and carries a nonce this process
  has not seen inside that window -- or it is answered 403 `EDGE_NOT_TRUSTED`
  before routing, identity or body. The subject and groups the application
  then reads are **the verified assertion's**: the guard removes every
  identity header the request arrived with and writes those two from the
  assertion, so a header a misconfigured proxy forwarded unsigned decides
  nothing (`docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Phase 13 exit check).
- *Dev mode* (no key): served only when both socket ends are loopback
  addresses and `Host` is `localhost`, `127.0.0.1` or `[::1]`. A published port
  on a keyless image therefore answers health and nothing else, and a DNS
  rebinding page is refused by its `Host`. No edge asserted anything here, so
  `server/api/identity.py` reads no groups header at all in this mode: a peer
  that passes the loopback check is READER unless the development switch is on.

In both modes the assertion header is removed from the scope, so no
application, log or refusal downstream can hold it; a repeated or lookalike
identity header is 401 `NOT_AUTHENTICATED`; `/api` is checked for Origin and
`Sec-Fetch-Site` (the second half of Task 4.2's CSRF split); and every response
carries the security headers and policy, with no cookie and no CORS header.

No header value is ever logged, formatted into a body or compared outside
`hmac.compare_digest`: the refusal bodies are constants. The nonce register is
one process's memory: the image runs one uvicorn worker, and a second process
would hold a register of its own (recorded in `CLAUDE.md`'s ledger).
