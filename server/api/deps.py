"""The shared request dependencies every section read, command and `app.py`
itself declare on their routes: who is asking, the ids the request names, the
caller's visibility of the case, the request's store connection, the blob
store, and the process's vendored methodology bundle.

Moved out of `server/api/app.py` (Task 4.1c) so the section reads under
`server/api/reads/` can depend on these functions directly instead of each
declaring its own lazily-imported wrapper. `app.py` used to be imported by
every section module (to register its router), which made importing `app.py`'s
dependencies from a section module a cycle -- whichever module loaded first
would find the other half-built. This module has no such edge: nothing here
imports `server.api.app`, so both `app.py` and `server/api/reads/*.py` import
it directly, and a test overriding one of these functions reaches every route
that declares it, section reads included.

`app.py` imports and re-exports every name here (`from server.api.deps import
store_connection as store_connection`, and so on) so `server.api.app.<name>` is
still the same function object -- an existing override of `app_module.X`
overrides this module's `X` too, because they are one object under two names.
`app.py`'s `_lifespan` keeps using `_database_url` the same way.

The id parsers (`case_path`, `run_path`, `run_query`, `revision_query`) are
typed `str` and parsed here rather than typed `UUID`, so a malformed id is
answered in the declared refusal body instead of FastAPI's 422 -- and, as
dependencies declared after identity and before the store, without opening a
connection. `visible_case` is the one round trip this module makes: the
caller's live standing on the path's case, refused as a private
`CASE_NOT_FOUND` below the reading floor, so an unknown case and a case the
caller may not read are one answer.

    answer to a stranger does not depend on the store being reachable: a process
    that has lost its database still says "I do not know who you are", which is
    the only one of the two answers that is about the caller.

    It closes the anonymous half and not the whole of it. A request asserting
