"""A reviewer signs a qualification verdict (F17's producer half; §65).

The one write in this system that is not a case's. Qualification spans a set
of cases, so there is no case to lock, no `case_members` standing to hold and
no governed unit through `run_command`: the write is `record_verdict`, in one
transaction, and the store's own bindings are what refuse it -- provider, set
digest and build must equal the recorded evidence, and the snapshot must be
`complete`. Nothing here repeats those checks; it maps them to the wire.

Three things the route keeps apart.

*The document is the reviewer's.* The body is the six bindings `read_verdict`
declares and nothing else, closed at the wire and read once, by that reader,
against the store's clock. The host originates none of it.

*The identity is the host's.* `reviewer_id` is `Actor.user_id`, derived at the
edge from the subject the proxy asserted. A body naming one is an undeclared
field and is refused before a connection opens.

*The floor is the top global rank.* A verdict turns every case's qualification
label to one person's word, which makes it the first authority here that is
account-wide rather than case-scoped -- the case `CLAUDE.md`'s ledger reserved
for the global role. Everywhere else an ANALYST's write needs case standing on
top of the role; with no case to stand on, the only separation available is
rank, and `_RANK` says which is highest. A caller below it is answered as a
stranger to a case is: not found, disclosing nothing about which evidence the
store holds.
