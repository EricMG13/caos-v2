"""The governed commands under `/api/v1/cases` (Task 4.2), and the one
global write, a qualification verdict (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §65).

One module per command family, each owning its `APIRouter` and `IO_BUDGET`:
`cases` (create case, admission), `runs` (route, input, preview, approval) and
`execution` (start, retry, cancel) and `qualification` (sign a verdict).
`_request` holds the dependencies they share; `server/api/app.py` includes
the four routers.
