"""The request half every command shares (Task 4.2 decisions 2, 5 and 6).

A command route declares its dependencies in decision 2's order, and FastAPI
solves them in declaration order:

    actor: Caller, key: Key, standing: <require_case_*>, body: <json_body>, conn

1. Identity -- anonymous is 401 before anything else.
2. Path ids -- a case id that cannot be read is `CASE_NOT_FOUND`.
3. `Idempotency-Key` -- missing or malformed is 400
   `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REQUIRED`, before a connection opens or a body is read.
4. Visibility -- no live standing on the case is 404 `CASE_NOT_FOUND`,
   whatever the global role.
5. Global role -- a write needs ANALYST or ADMIN; READER is 403.
6. Floor -- standing below the command's floor is 403 `NOT_AUTHORISED`.
7. Body -- bounded, closed, and any failure 400 `REQUEST_INVALID`, never
   FastAPI's 422 that quotes the input.

Advisory: the governed write rechecks standing under the case lock at commit.

`governed` is the envelope every case-scoped command ends in: the request's
canonical digest, `run_command`'s replay-or-commit, and the receipt on the
wire. Promoted from `execution.py`, where it was private, once `runs.py` had
written it out three more times.
