"""`Chrome.actions`: what each command would answer, judged from a read's facts.

Task 4.2 decision 10. Pure functions over facts the section reads already hold,
each action's checks in the order its command makes them (decision 7), so an
action refused here names the code its command would answer now. Advisory and
granting nothing: the command rechecks every one of these at commit, under the
case lock and live standing ("Persona is not authority"). A fact a read cannot
hold -- a body the client has not yet written, a digest it has not yet seen --
is the command's to refuse, never assumed here.
