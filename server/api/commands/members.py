"""Case standing, and the withdrawal of a source (Task 12.1).

Three governed writes the store has always had and nothing could reach. Each
is one `run_command` unit through the shared envelope, in decision 2's
dependency order, so a stranger is answered the private 404 before a member id
or a source id is parsed.

Standing is the case's own authority, so both membership commands take the
ADMIN floor: a WRITER who could grant themselves APPROVER would make the floor
on every other command a formality. Withdrawal takes WRITER, the floor
`withdraw_source` already declared.

A revocation that revoked nothing is refused rather than recorded, for the
reason the withdrawal beside it gives: the chain must not say something
happened when nothing did.
