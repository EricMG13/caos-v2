"""What a case stream calls each stored event, and where a resume starts.

Brief 4.4 decisions 2 and 3. A frame names which sections to refetch and
nothing else, so every `RunEvent` and every audit action the server writes maps
to one closed `EventName` -- or is declared silent, because the section it
would refresh is not enabled. A test reads the server's `GovernedAction` call
sites and refuses a mapping that misses one.

The cursor is composite, `{audit_seq}.{run_seq}`: the case's audit chain and
the named run's events are numbered separately and have no common order.

No round trip: `IO_BUDGET = 0`.
