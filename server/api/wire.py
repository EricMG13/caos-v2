"""The wire contract under `/api/`: the one refusal body and the v1 sections.

Phase 4 Task 4.1, decision 3. Every non-success response carries
`RefusalBody{code, clears}`; `clears` is `CLEARS[code]`, a host constant that
says what would clear the refusal. It is never formatted, so no request or
document text can reach it. `server/refusals.py` stays code-only.

Decisions 5, 6 and 8: one closed document per enabled section, every key
required, every string and list bounded. Task 4.2, decisions 1, 10 and 11: the
closed command requests and receipts (`V1_COMMANDS`), and the server-computed
`Chrome.actions`. `python -m server.api.wire` prints their JSON Schema,
committed at `frontend/src/wire/v1/schema.json` (`tests/test_wire_contract.py`
proves the two equal).
