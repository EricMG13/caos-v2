"""`GET /api/health`: readiness over store, bundle and blobs, read from a cache.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §11 and the Phase 4 task 4.5 brief, slice 4.5b. One background
task, started in the app's lifespan, runs the three probes every
`PROBE_INTERVAL` seconds; each probe runs in a worker thread under
`PROBE_DEADLINE`, and a round already in flight is never started twice. The
route reads only what the last round left, so a request -- anonymous, unguarded,
as often as anyone likes -- costs no store connection, no bundle read and no
filesystem call. A round older than `STALE_AFTER` is not trusted, and before
the first round nothing is.

The body is codes and a timestamp only: no path, no URL, no exception text.
A probe that raises is its failure code, and nothing of what it raised.
