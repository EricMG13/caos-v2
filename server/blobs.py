"""The content-addressed blob store. Bytes in, `sha256` out, verified on the way back.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 2 keeps bytes out of the database: rows hold a digest.
The digest is only worth holding if reading it back proves it, so `get` re-hashes
what it read and refuses what does not match. Nothing else in the system can tell
a source document apart from a plausible replacement of it.

A blob is written under a temporary name and renamed into place, so the address
either holds the whole blob or holds nothing. A partial file at the final address
would fail every later read for the life of the store.
