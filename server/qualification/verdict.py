"""The reviewer's signature, read rather than minted.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 10: a verdict is bound to provider identity,
qualification-set digest, build, date, expiry and reviewer. This module reads
such a document and either returns a `Verdict` or refuses -- it never builds one
from anything the host knows about itself.

Why six. A signature saying "the outputs met the answer keys" is checkable only
if it also says whose outputs, against which cases, from which build, signed
when, current until when, and by whom. Drop `provider` and the same sentence
covers a model nobody measured. Drop `qualification_set_sha256` and it covers a
set of answer keys that has since been edited. Drop `build_id` and it covers
next year's methodology. Drop the dates and it never stops applying. Drop
`reviewer` and nobody is accountable for it. So a missing binding is
`VERDICT_INCOMPLETE` rather than a `None` field, and the reader refuses before
anything downstream can read a hole as a pass.

Expiry is judged against a `now` the caller passes, not against the clock. Route
resolution is pure for the same reason (`CLAUDE.md`): a decision that reads the
clock cannot be replayed, and a verdict's currency is exactly the kind of
decision someone will later need to re-take at the moment it was taken.
