"""The qualification set, its answer keys, and the matrix a reviewer reads.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 10. A **qualification set** is the immutable cases
and answer keys one verdict is measured against (`CONTEXT.md`); its digest is
one of the six bindings `read_verdict` requires, and this module is where that
digest is computed.

**The matrix reports; it does not conclude.** Comparing a run against an answer
key is mechanical, and the host may do it. Deciding that the comparison is good
enough is a reviewer's signature — `QUALIFIED` is their word, not the host's
(`server/qualification/__init__.py`). So nothing here carries a verdict, a pass
flag or a score: a row states what the host could prove on its own and which
expected citations the run produced, and a reviewer reads the rows.

That is also why a row survives its own failure. An unprovable case is a row
carrying its refusal code, not an exception that ends the matrix: stopping at
the first one would hand a reviewer less than the host knows, and what the
remaining cases did is the next thing they would ask.

**What an answer key can express, and what it cannot.** A key names citations —
which quote, from which document, under which module. That is the strongest key
the canonical handoff's record can be checked against today, because a record
carries projections and citations and not typed figures. A key saying "net
leverage is 4.2x" has nothing to compare against until the record carries the
figure as a number, which is the known-gaps entry this module ships with.

Beside the citations a key may also ask what a module *concluded*
(`ExpectedProjection`, over the seven fields the host projects) and what it
*wrote in a named register cell* (`ExpectedRegister`, read through the vendor's
own register reader). None of the three is the conclusion's soundness, and a
reviewer still reads the rows.

**A canonical run is scored on its records** (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §42.4), and
only on what the proof proved: the proof returns the citations it re-anchored
under the pinned modules, and those are the run's -- nothing is read again, so
an artifact accepted after the proof is not scored, and a source withdrawn since
refuses the row. An unproven canonical run cites nothing. The matrix reports no
status a record projects, so a SCREENING_ONLY record can never reach a reviewer
through it as committee clearance.
