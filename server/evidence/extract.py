"""Text into tokens that carry where they were.

Invariant 11 needs four things per token: the page, the layout region, the line,
and a rectangle. A citation is re-located by joining tokens within a line and
continuing only onto the next line of the same region, so a quote can never be
assembled across a column gutter -- the two columns are different regions and the
phrase never forms (`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 5).

What extracts them is deliberately an argument. This module ships the plain-text
extractor, which is honest about what it is: a `.txt` document has no typography,
so its rectangles are the cells of a fixed-pitch rendering at `CELL`, stated here
rather than implied. `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` owes Phase 6 a real PDF fixture
through a real extractor (`test_citations_anchor_in_an_extracted_pdf`); that
extractor implements the same protocol and nothing above this module changes.
