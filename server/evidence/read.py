"""`read_evidence`: the host boundary a module receives evidence through.

Invariant 2: validated at the boundary, fails closed with a typed code, and **no
text is returned on refusal** -- not in the exception chain, the delivered set,
or the ledger. Every refusal here is raised `from None` for that reason: a
chained `psycopg` error carries the statement, and the statement carries the
identifiers a document was stored under.

One code answers every unavailable read. Distinguishing "no such source" from
"withdrawn" from "no such block" would tell a caller which of the three it
guessed right, and a caller entitled to know already has the delivered set.
Stored text retains historical typed BoundaryText refusals without its contents.
