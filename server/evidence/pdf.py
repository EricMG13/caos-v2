"""A real PDF into tokens that carry where they were.

`docs/DECISIONS.md` §21. `pdfminer.six` exposes a layout tree that maps exactly
onto the three things invariant 11 needs from a token:

    LTTextBox   -> the region a quote may not leave
    LTTextLine  -> the line it sits on
    LTChar      -> the rectangle, taken from the character rather than estimated

The last one is the point. `PlainTextExtractor` derives rectangles from a
declared fixed pitch, which is honest for a `.txt` file and is a fiction for a
PDF. Here the coordinates come out of the document, so a citation's rectangle is
a measurement rather than a reconstruction.

Rectangles are given in one convention whatever the page (§44.3): points from
the CropBox's top-left corner as the page is displayed, after `/Rotate`, with y
growing downward. Identity version 2 declares it beside the layout parameters
that decide where a word, a line and a region end.

Nothing above this module changes. It implements the same `Extractor` protocol,
so ingestion, block packing, citation anchoring and every refusal are the ones
already tested -- which is what a seam is for.

The walk runs in a child interpreter (§47). One page of a few kilobytes can
inflate to gigabytes or hold millions of operators, and neither is visible
between pages, so the parent kills the child at the deadline and the child's
inflater refuses past `max_decoded_bytes`: both bounds hold whatever pdfminer is
doing. The child is `python -I` with an empty environment -- no credential, no
caller's `__main__` re-run -- and speaks JSON, so nothing it prints is code.
