"""Invariant 11: the host re-locates the quote, and refuses one it cannot.

A citation as a module offers it is `{source_id, page, matched_text}`. What
reaches an artifact is that plus the coordinates the host derived by finding the
quote in its own token index. The module never supplies a rectangle, because a
rectangle it supplied would be a claim nobody checked.

Two rules make the search honest:

*Exactly once.* A quote found twice is refused rather than resolved to the first
match. Highlighting one of two identical sentences asserts a precision the host
does not have.

*Never across a region.* Matching joins tokens within a line and continues only
onto the next line of the same region (`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 5). Two columns
are two regions, so a phrase cannot be assembled across the gutter between them --
which is what a naive scan of page text does, and what it silently produces is a
quote that exists nowhere on the page.

The result is one rectangle per line the quote covers, the shape a PDF
highlight's QuadPoints uses and for the same reason: selected text wraps, and a
single enclosing rectangle would cover text the quote does not contain.
