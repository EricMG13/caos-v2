"""A reservation priced from the configured model (F06, §16, §40).

The provider is asked at most `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` of request and
`MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS` of completion (§38). With no tokenizer, the conservative
input bound is one token per request byte, so the cost of one call is at most
`request bytes * input + MAX_COMPLETION_TOKENS * output`. That is
`priced_request`, and it is what every call reserves: the bytes the provider
will actually be sent, not the largest request the transport would carry.

`worst_case` is the same arithmetic at `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`. It is the run's
admission check -- a ceiling that cannot afford one call at its worst is refused
before an attempt exists -- and no longer a per-call reservation, because
reserving the transport ceiling per call made a three-node route unaffordable
under any sane ceiling at a real model's rates (Task 8.2).

Neither is a forecast. An application price cannot guarantee a vendor bill; the
known charge is still reconciled after the call, and an overrun consumes the
remaining capacity. The price a reservation was taken under is stored beside it,
so a row can be read back to the dated price that produced it.
