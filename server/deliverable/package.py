    into place, so a crash or an I/O failure part-way leaves nothing at the

    name was then refused by every correct write that followed it -- a path
    permanently poisoned by a package nobody could verify.

    within one filesystem, and the directory is fsynced after the link so the
    *name* is durable and not just its contents: a reader after a power loss
