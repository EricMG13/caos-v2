"""Per-node evidence selection from CP-0's T8 `Source files to attach` (§95).

The gate's accepted T8 carries, per consumer module, the vendor's own
`Recommendation.source_files_to_attach` (§92, one reader of one table). The
host maps that cell to the run's pinned source-set members and delivers a
consumer only those members' blocks. Everything here is a pure function of
pinned inputs -- the accepted CP-0 Markdown, the pinned members, the module
id -- so every reader that builds a node's context (the pre-call check, the
attempt, a crash replay) selects the same blocks (invariant 10), and no host
rule invents a demand the gate did not write (invariant 4).

Three outcomes, fail-closed in the direction that matters:

- **named**: every item of the cell maps to exactly one member -- by its
  admitted filename or its document digest -- and the node is handed those
  members and nothing else.
- **whole**: the cell is empty, or names nothing the pin carries. The host
  cannot read it as a selection, so it delivers what every run before §95
  delivered. Narrowing on a guess would turn a truthful quote of an unnamed
  source into `CITATION_NOT_DELIVERED` (§88.2); a whole delivery weakens no
  invariant, and a prompt too wide for the ceiling still refuses
  `CONTEXT_OVER_CEILING` rather than truncating.
- **refused**: the cell is half-readable -- some items map and some do not --
  or an item maps to more than one member. Either narrowing to the readable
  half or widening to the whole would decide something the gate did not say,
  so the node refuses `EVIDENCE_DEMAND_UNRESOLVED` before any attempt,
  reservation or call. The discharge is a successor run whose CP-0 writes a
  cell the host can read.

§98 adds the page grain, in the form the bundle states (REF_CP-0_STEPS.md,
Step I rules 5 and 8). An item may name pages of a member --
`<filename> pages <first>-<last>` or `<filename> page <n>` -- and the node is
then handed those pages of it; a range the member cannot carry refuses as a
half-readable cell does. And the gate, which is always handed the whole pin, is
shown a source past `GATE_SOURCE_BYTES` as its page map (`gate_view`): the
largest uniform number of leading lines of every page that fits the bound, every
line whole, the rest withheld and said to be withheld in the prompt's host
preparation metadata. A page is the stored `page` of a block: a PDF's page, or
the plain-text extractor's declared sixty-line fixed-pitch page.
