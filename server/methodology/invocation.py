"""One canonical invocation: the host identity from the store, then its prompt (§41).

`host_identity` reads every host-owned fact from what the store pinned -- the
run input's subject and vendor run id, the attempt's stored ordinal, the pinned
route and the accepted upstream artifacts -- so no caller's copy of an identity
survives (invariant 3). `build_handoff_prompt` hands the module those exact
front-matter lines to copy, every delivered authority file whole, the exact
upstream Markdown as context labelled with its edge's `allowed_use`, a register
of each upstream's host-anchored citations (quote existence proven, support left
to CP-5), and every delivered block as evidence. `within_request_ceiling`
bounds the whole encoded request the provider would send, and refuses an
over-ceiling context rather than cut anything out of it (§45).

`canonical.py` calls both for every canonical attempt, before and after the
call, and once under `prospective_identity` before the attempt exists.

    in its own section named with its digest, `SKILL.md` first; any other
    module's set, or a file that is not UTF-8, refuses
    `AUTHORITY_BYTES_MISMATCH`. `upstream` must be exactly `identity.upstream`
