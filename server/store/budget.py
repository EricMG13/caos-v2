"""Reservations. Invariant 8: every ceiling refuses the next operation.

No provider call without a reservation, and the reservation is taken *before* the
call. A ceiling checked afterwards is an invoice.

Two properties are deliberate and both cost money on purpose:

*The reservation commits on its own.* It does not ride the transaction that later
accepts the artifact. A process that died after the provider completed would
otherwise roll back the record of money that was really spent, and the retry
would reserve against a ceiling that had forgotten it.

*A reservation names its price.* The four `price_*` columns hold the dated
price the amount was computed from (§40). The amount alone cannot be read back
to one -- many prices and request sizes reach the same number -- and the unit
that later spends reads the price back to check that the request it is about to
send still fits what was set aside.

*Nothing is released.* An indeterminate call may have reached the provider and
may be billed (`docs/DECISIONS.md` §16: `PROVIDER_UNAVAILABLE` leaves the attempt
indeterminate with its reservation). Releasing it would let the retry spend money
the run has already committed. A retry is a new attempt and a new reservation --
the price of a provider with no idempotency key, paid knowingly.
