"""Idempotent governed commands: one receipt per `(actor, scope, key)`.

Task 4.2 decision 6. A command is a governed write (`server/store/audit.py`)
whose unit also records the receipt it answered with, as the unit's last
domain statement. Four predicates decide every retry:

- **Same key, same request** -- `find_receipt` before the unit finds the
  committed receipt and replays its status and body, writing nothing.
- **Same key, different request** -- the stored `request_sha256` differs:
  `IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSED`, committing nothing.
- **Concurrent twins** -- under a case scope the twin waits at the case lock
  and the in-unit lookup finds the first commit's receipt. Under the nil scope
  (create case) nothing is shared but the primary key: the twin's
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` waits for the first transaction, then
  inserts zero rows. Either way the twin's whole unit is rolled back and it
  replays or refuses.
- **A lost commit acknowledgement** -- the unit either committed with its
  receipt or did not; the client's retry finds out which through the lookup.

Refusals commit nothing, so a key is never burned by a refused request. A
revoked member's receipts are kept; the route's visibility check answers their
replay before the lookup is reached.
