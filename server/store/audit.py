"""Governed writes: authority at the commit, and an audit event beside the state.

Two rules meet here.

*`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §8 — commit time.* The gap between checking standing and
committing is a real window: a request arrives, the actor is a WRITER, work
happens, their membership is revoked, and the commit lands anyway. So the check
is inside the store call that writes, not in the route that called it.

*`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §2 — transactional pairing.* A governed write commits its state
and its audit event in one transaction, or neither. The caller's write runs
inside this function's transaction for exactly that reason: it cannot commit on
its own, so it cannot land without its event.

`audit_events` is hash-chained per case under the existing case row lock.
The chain has no external anchor, so what it gives is *detection*: an entry
edited in place no longer hashes to what the next one says came before it, and a
retained package's head no longer matches the live one.
