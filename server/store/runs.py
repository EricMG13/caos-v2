"""Cases and the runs that belong to them.

The two rows every later part of Phase 1 hangs off: a run's events are ordered
under its row lock, its attempts and charges reference it, and its terminal event
is the one `test_terminal_event_is_exactly_once` counts.

Who commits, and why it differs: `create_case` and `start_run` do not, because
they are setup and their caller may want them beside something else. The three
transitions below do, because each one *is* a unit of work in the sense the
pairing rule means (`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 2) -- state and its event, together
or not at all. Leaving that commit to a caller would leave the invariant to a
caller.
