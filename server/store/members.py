"""Case standing: who may do what, on which case.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §8. Case standing and global role are separate and both are
rechecked at commit time. This module answers the first question; the recheck
happens inside `server/store/audit.py`'s `governed_write`, because a check
anywhere else is a check at request time wearing a different name.

Standing is ordered. An ADMIN can do what a WRITER can, which is why `requires`
is a floor rather than an equality -- an authority model that demanded the exact
standing would refuse an administrator doing an ordinary thing.
