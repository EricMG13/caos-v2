"""The run work queue: one claim per run, fenced by a token (brief D1-D4).

A run with no `run_work` row is driven by a direct caller (the harness, tests).
Once enqueued, only the holder of its current lease may write to it. The token,
not the clock, is the fence: every claim advances it, so a holder whose lease
expired and was reclaimed carries a token no row still matches.

Lock order is case, then run (`lock_run`), then `run_work`. `claim_run` takes
only the work row and commits alone. Every other function here rides its
caller's transaction and leaves the commit to it, so a command's governed write,
its audit event and its queue effect commit together or not at all.
