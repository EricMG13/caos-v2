"""The harness: a qualification set performed, not merely compared.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 10 names three things — "the qualification-set
harness, the answer keys, the matrix". The keys and the matrix landed first and
`build_matrix` had to be handed a `runs` mapping it could not produce, because
`QualificationSet` modelled only half of what `CONTEXT.md` says a set is: "the
immutable **cases** and answer keys". A case is its inputs. Without them there
is nothing to perform.

So a case now carries its documents and the route it is run under, alongside the
citations a correct run must produce, and `perform` admits each case, runs it,
and hands the matrix the mapping it used. The set's digest covers the inputs
too — two sets with identical answer keys over different documents are different
sets, and a verdict binding one must not read as binding the other.

What the harness must not become: a second execution path. It calls `run_route`
like every other caller, through the same provider seam, under the same
reservations. A qualification run that took a shortcut would be qualifying a
system nobody ships.

And what only the harness can report. `assert_orchestration_proof` proves the
artifacts a run **accepted** -- true, and narrower than "the route ran". The
harness resolved and pinned the route, so it holds the node list the proof is
silent about: a `Performed` carries the run's own status and the pinned nodes
that produced nothing. That is only observable on a run that stopped short,
which is why a case whose execution refuses is recorded rather than raised --
recorded, not swallowed, in a typed field beside the proof.
