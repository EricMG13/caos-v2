"""Negative end-to-end proofs on the realistic LITE route (Task 3.4 slice 3.4d).

Each test drives `run_route` -> runner -> canonical executor -> vendor
validators with the realistic, vendor-derived handoffs of
`tests/lite_route_fixtures.py`, then asks the orchestration proof and the
canonical deliverable what they make of the run. A Blocked, malformed,
truncated, wrong-upstream or undelivered-citation CP-L10 answer is billed and
kept only as attempt evidence: CP-5 is never called, nothing downstream is
accepted, the proof covers only CP-0 and the deliverable refuses. Injected
source text changes no host-owned route, authority, front matter or identity.

REPAIR_PLAN Phase 3 exit checks: blocked/invalid output is retained only as
diagnostic attempt evidence, never as usable downstream analysis; a missing or
changed predecessor prevents acceptance; source text carries no authority.
