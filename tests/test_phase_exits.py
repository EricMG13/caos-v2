"""The plan's own standing rule, made executable.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`: "A phase is exited by its named tests, and
`test_every_exit_test_of_an_exited_phase_exists` refuses a later phase starting
before they are written."

That test was named in the seed and never written, which is the sort of thing
this repository is otherwise careful about: a rule enforced by intention rather
than by a tool is not enforced. It reads the plan, collects every test the plan
names, and checks the suite defines it.

*Which* suite is the part that took a second pass. The plan names tests across
both halves of this repository: Phases 1-8 are Python, and Phase 9 is the
workspace, whose passport and snapshot binding are TypeScript and whose tests
are therefore TypeScript too. A gate that read `tests/` alone would have to
excuse every one of them permanently, which is indistinguishable from not
gating them -- so it reads `frontend/tests/` as well, and Phase 9's two names
left the excuse list the day it did.

What it cannot do is decide which phase is current -- so the phases not yet
reached are listed below, explicitly, with the reason each is absent. That list
is the whole point: adding code for a phase without its named test fails this,
and so does quietly deleting a test that already exists.
