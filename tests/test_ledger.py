"""The known-gaps ledger's own gate.

`CLAUDE.md` states the rule this enforces: "A ledger entry that describes a gap
the tree has since closed is the same defect as a missing one, read the other
way round." Two ways of getting there are mechanical, and this file is both.

The first is citation rot. An entry earns its keep by naming the test that holds
it open, and a named test that no longer exists turns the entry into an
assurance nobody runs. The second is the half-closed entry: this repository's
convention is that an open entry ends in an `*Upgrade:*` clause, so an entry
with no upgrade path has either been closed without being struck or was written
without saying what would close it.

What this cannot do is read an entry's prose and decide whether the tree still
behaves that way. Two entries were struck by hand in the commit that added this
file -- one claiming there was no `qualification_verdicts` table, one claiming a
proof was held and never stored -- and no rule here would have caught either,
because both were fluent, both cited nothing, and both kept their upgrade
clause while becoming false. Phrase-based rules were tried against the real
file and rejected: the best of them flagged three entries, of which one was the
genuine defect and two were correct entries using the same words. That limit is
recorded in the ledger under Completion Phase 7 rather than papered over with a
gate that looks stronger than it is.
