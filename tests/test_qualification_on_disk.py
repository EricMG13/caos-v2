"""A qualification set as a declared form on disk, and the loader that reads it.

`CLAUDE.md`'s Phase 10 ledger: a set lived in memory and was digested, not
stored -- "enough for the binding to be checkable and not enough for two people
to be sure they hold the same set without comparing digests by hand". Once a
case carried its documents as bytes it got worse: a set of any size became a
Python literal nobody would write.

The property that makes the form worth having is one line long: **a set read
from disk digests identically to the same set built in memory**. Without it the
file would be a convenience that quietly changes what a verdict binds. With it,
a reviewer can be handed a directory, and the digest in the verdict is a
statement about the bytes in their hands.

What the loader refuses is the other half. The file is authored by someone --
possibly not by this repository, possibly years later -- so it is read the way
`read_verdict` reads a verdict: a closed shape, refusals apart by remedy, and
nothing taken on trust. A document path that leaves the set's directory is the
one refusal that is about safety rather than shape.
