"""Why a billed answer was not accepted, written once (Task 4.3 slice d, D7).

`record_refusal` explains a recorded call's answer so a retry never replays a
known refusal. It writes only for an attempt with a call outcome, only once,
and never for a code that describes the store, the run or its fence.
