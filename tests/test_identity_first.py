"""Identity before the store, stated by each route rather than by parameter order.

FastAPI solves a route's parameter dependencies in the order the signature
declares them, so `actor: Caller` ahead of `conn: Store` used to be the whole of
what kept an anonymous request off a connection. A route's decorator-level
`dependencies=` are inserted at the *front* of its dependency list whatever the
parameters say, which is what `IDENTITY_FIRST` on every store-touching decorator
buys: the order is a declaration on the route, not a property of its signature.
