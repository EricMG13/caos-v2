"""The contract test for `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_DECISION_LEDGER` (CP-0 -> CP-8).

Two nodes and one REQUIRED edge, `decision_scope: SCREENING_ONLY`, and CP-8
is the terminal deliverable: it post-mortems a recorded decision against a
later outcome. Nothing here is new machinery -- the route runs through the same
`run_route` -> `ModuleProvider` -> canonical executor -> vendor validators ->
proof -> canonical deliverable path every enabled pathway uses. What is proven
is the pathway: it completes, proves and freezes over a two-document pack (the
T0 decision record and the T1 outcome, one citation from each); its requests
fit the request ceiling; a CP-0 verdict that blocks CP-8 stops the run before
any further call; and a validated Blocked CP-8 -- which its own gate requires
when no decision record is available, rather than a thesis reconstructed after
the fact -- ends the run BLOCKED and is recorded as the verdict that did.

CP-8's LITE compatibility block is `PROFILE_AGNOSTIC` with no accepted LITE
object, so `named_objects` holds no boundary here and CP-8 is held by nothing
but CP-0's readiness verdict. Every provider is deterministic; no live call is
made.
