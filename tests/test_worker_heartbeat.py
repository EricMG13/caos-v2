"""Completion Phase 13.3: a stalled queue is visible, not only in a log.

The ledger entry this closes: "The worker has no readiness. The API's
`/api/health` probes the store, bundle and blob root it uses;
`server/engine/worker.py` serves no listener, and `compose.smoke.yaml` gives
the worker no healthcheck. A worker that exited 2 (`PROVIDER_NOT_CONFIGURED`)
or is backing off on store faults is visible only in its exit code and logs,
and a queued run simply waits."

Two things are deliberately *not* done. The worker still serves no listener --
a process that already talks to PostgreSQL every poll does not need a second
protocol to say it is alive. And a missing worker does **not** make the API
`not_ready`: the API is not the worker, and an API that reported itself unready
because a queue was stalled would take the surface down with it. The worker's
state is its own field, which is what an operator alerts on.
