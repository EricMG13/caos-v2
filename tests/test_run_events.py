"""Phase 1 exit test: a crash in the commit gap yields one of everything.

Invariant 6 (CLAUDE.md): execution is durable and exactly-once. `SYSTEM_SPEC.md`
section 2 says how -- a run-state transition commits its state and its event in
one transaction, every event insert rides a conditional update whose zero rows
mean no event, and `run_events.seq` is allocated under the run row lock.

The commit gap is the window between the work being done and the transaction
that records it landing. A process can die on either side of the commit and must
not be able to tell the difference afterwards: replaying the same completion
must leave one artifact, one charge and one terminal event, never two.
