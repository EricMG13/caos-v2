"""Phase 6 exit: the stream stops reading a run once its terminal is delivered.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §9, as brief 4.4 decisions 3 and 4 restate it for the case
stream. A frame carries a composite cursor and a name, and nothing else: the
client never reads a payload -- a name triggers a refetch. These tests drive
`case_tail` as a generator, which is where a pause between two frames can be
held exactly; `tests/test_case_events.py` drives the same rules over a socket.
