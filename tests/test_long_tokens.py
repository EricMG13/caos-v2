"""The first obstacle between the large 10-K texts and admission.

The ledger entry: "a single token past the boundary limit refuses the whole
pack, and that is what stops the large 10-K texts". `ingest._prepare` calls
`BoundaryText.of` on every token before a block is packed, so Boeing's
71,243-character and Ford's 105,966-character single runs refuse
`BOUNDARY_TEXT_TOO_LONG` at the door -- before any line is grouped, and with
nothing the line group can do about it. Its upgrade names the extractor,
"which is where a token's boundaries are decided".

Splitting rather than refusing, for the same reason the line group splits: a
refusal leaves the document unadmissible and every honest word in it
uncitable, where a split costs only the artefact itself. What a 71,243-
character run with no whitespace in it actually is -- a base64 blob, a rule of
dashes, a mangled extraction -- is not something a reader could quote either.
