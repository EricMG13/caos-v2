"""Phase 10's first exit: what a verdict has to bind before it is one.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` Phase 10: "A verdict is bound to provider identity,
qualification-set digest, build, date, expiry and reviewer." Six bindings, and a
verdict missing any of them is refused rather than read with a hole in it.

The six are not decoration. A reviewer's signature that says the outputs met the
answer keys means nothing unless it also says *whose* outputs, measured against
*which* cases, produced by *which* build, signed *when*, current *until when*,
and by *whom*. Drop any one and the signature stops being checkable: the same
sentence would cover a different provider, a different qualification set, or a
build shipped a year later.
