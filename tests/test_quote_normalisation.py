"""Task 10.5: the two normalisations `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` Phase 10 names.

Its exit check is "a letter-spaced heading and a quote ending in a full stop
anchor to the rectangle a reader sees". Both are refused today, and both are
refused for a reason the host created: the full stop because a quote is split
on whitespace and every word must equal a token, and the heading because
pdfminer inserts a virtual word break between glyphs tracked past
`word_margin` (`§44.5`), so the word comes back one token per letter.

Two rules, and the order between them is the whole of their safety. The exact
search runs first and unchanged; a normalised search runs **only** when the
exact one found nothing. So the widening is monotone -- every quote that
anchored before anchors to the same rectangles, and every stored record
re-verifies -- and a normalisation can never resolve an ambiguity, because an
ambiguous exact match never reaches it.
