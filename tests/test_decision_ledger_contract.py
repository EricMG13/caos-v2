"""CP-8's canonical contract, on the one pathway that carries it.

`LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_DECISION_LEDGER` is CP-0 -> CP-8 and nothing else, so
CP-8's contract tests run over that route rather than parametrised beside the
RELATIVE_VALUE owners (`tests/test_owner_contracts.py`): the same five
boundaries. The three that need no run are here -- a missing register, a wrong
upstream, a restricted handoff keeping its limitations; the two that do -- a
validated, identified, projected and anchored acceptance, and an unanchored
quote -- run the route and live beside it in
`tests/test_lite_decision_ledger_route.py`.

**What a fixture can fake and what a key can pin (Task 9.3 step 1).** CP-8's
eight registers are all critical, so each must be filled, and the fixture
fills them from the authored decision memo and outcome extract in
`canonical_route_fixtures.LEDGER_PACK`. Three of them are judgement a fixture
can only *assert*, never prove: T7.5's attribution label and process verdict,
T7.6's calibration register (pattern-gated to three decisions, so on one
decision it can only say there is no pattern) and T7.7's roll-up. A key over
those would measure the key author's judgement against the model's. What a
key *can* pin is what a document settles: T7.1's decision date and T7.2's
expectations are read off the T0 record, and T7.3's realised values are read
off the T1 document, so a module that reconstructs its thesis after the fact
or misreads an outcome misses a key; T7.4's `Expected` cells must equal what
T7.2 recorded. That is the split `qualification/ccl-fy2025-decision-ledger/`
keys by.

Every provider is deterministic; no live call is made.
