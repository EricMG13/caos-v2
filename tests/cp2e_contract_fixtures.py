At November 30, 2025 fixed-rate debt carrying value was ${facts.fixed_debt:.0f} million, floating-rate debt was ${facts.floating_debt:.0f} million and total debt was ${facts.total_debt:.0f} million.
As of November 30, 2025 there were no remaining interest-rate swaps; the $1.0 billion SOFR swaps were terminated in July 2025.
Based on a 100 basis point change in market interest rates, annual interest expense on floating-rate debt would change by approximately ${facts.floating_debt * 0.01:.0f} million.
Euro-denominated newbuild commitments for non-euro functional-currency brands were ${facts.newbuild_commitment:.0f} million; a 1% EUR/USD move changes remaining cost by ${facts.newbuild_commitment * facts.fx_move:.0f} million.
FY2025 segment fuel expense was ${facts.fuel_cost:.0f} million; a 10% fuel-cost stress is an analyst scenario, not management guidance.
EU ETS cost was ${facts.ets_cost:.0f} million in 2025 and all in-scope emissions apply in 2026.
