"""BoundaryText — the type every string crossing into pinned state must be.

Invariant (CLAUDE.md, standing rules): every string that can reach pinned state,
a revision, a frozen payload or an audit event carries BoundaryText, never a
bare str. NFC-normalised before the length bound; rejects lone surrogates, Cc
controls except CR/LF/TAB, and bidirectional override/isolate controls.

A bidi override is the attack this exists for: U+202E makes an audit event read
backwards on screen while the bytes say something else, so what a human approves
and what the store holds are different sentences.
