"""Phase 5: the bundle is authority, and it is checked on the bytes at use.

Invariant 4 (CLAUDE.md): integrity checked on the bytes at use, not at startup
only. A digest verified when the process booted says nothing about the file the
process is reading an hour later -- and the file is the methodology a credit
opinion rests on.

`docs/DECISIONS.md` §5 adds the one thing that must *not* happen here:
`assemble_authority` must not slice `SKILL.md` on section markers. The merged
upstream skill has dropped `## CP-PARSE runnable profile`, so slicing would
break CP-0 as well as CP-PARSE. CP-PARSE receives the whole CP-0 skill plus its
own reference files.
