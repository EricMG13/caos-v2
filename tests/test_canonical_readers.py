"""Canonical runs read back by the API and the harness (Task 3.1 slice d-1).

The route engine reads typed `NodeResult`s, and both readers now hand
`accepted_artifacts` the bundle, so a LITE run's gate verdicts and QA status
come from its records (§42.4) rather than refusing -- or, in the harness,
falling back to presence, which would read a gate-BLOCKED module as RUNNABLE.
