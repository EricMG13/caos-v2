"""Task 12.1: the seven governed writes reach the wire (O20).

Membership, withdrawal and the whole filing chain were store functions no
request path reached. Each is now one command through the shared envelope, so
what these prove is not that the store still works -- `tests/test_filing_chain.py`
and `tests/test_members.py` hold that -- but the three things a route adds:
the identity the caller may assert, the digest the request binds, and the
receipt a retry replays.

The three-actor rule is checked here over HTTP because that is where it can be
evaded: the Report section composes the control from what it can see, and a
signer whose browser still shows "Freeze" is refused at commit, under the case
lock, by the store and not by the view.
