"""The actor matrix: what a client may assert about itself.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`'s standing rules: "the first phase exposing an HTTP route
ships identity derivation and the actor matrix
(`test_production_never_trusts_role_header`,
`test_unauthorised_case_is_private_404`)". This is that phase; the second of the
pair lives with the route it is about, in `tests/test_api_routes.py`.

Both are the same instinct and the same refusal to indulge it. A role header is
convenient in development and is a client asserting its own authority; a 403 is
informative and tells a stranger the case exists. Each is the comfortable answer,
and each is refused.

The switch is off unless explicitly on. An environment variable that had to be
set to *disable* trust is one a misconfigured deployment forgets, and that
failure is silent and total.
