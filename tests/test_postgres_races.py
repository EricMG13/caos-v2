"""Every governed race proven on two independent connections.

`docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md` section 1 lists concurrency at ~2x in agent-written
code, and the control it names is this file: a race argued from the code is not
a race proven. One connection cannot prove a lock -- it never contends with
itself -- so each test here holds two.
