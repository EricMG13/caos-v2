"""Phase 2: bytes enter a case one way, and the whole pack enters or none of it.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 5: ingestion is the only way bytes enter a case, web
discovery is structurally absent, and a pack is admitted or refused in one
transaction. Invariant 1 is that runs execute against pinned sources; a pack that
half-landed is a source set nobody pinned.

The block shape is the other subject here. `docs/AI_CODE_QUALITY.md` section 1
measures excessive I/O at ~8x, the largest multiple in the report, and the
predecessor had exactly that defect: evidence blocks lived in one JSON column, so
every `read_evidence` parsed every block of a source. Blocks are one row each,
keyed by `(source_id, block_id)`, and `test_a_block_is_one_row_not_a_column`
is what stops that coming back.
