"""A live run, end to end: documents admitted, modules run, citations re-located.

Every link of this chain has its own test -- admission, route resolution, the
frontier loop, the provider, the proof -- and the live provider has answered a
single module (`test_module_execution.py`). Nothing drove the whole chain
against a model that really answers, so nothing showed the application working.
This does, with the provider built the way the application builds it: from the
environment (`OpenRouter.from_environment`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` §16).

Two documents, one per extractor, so the case holds a PDF as well as text. The
pathway is `LITE_EARNINGS_UPDATE` on `LITE_CREDIT_22` -- CP-0, CP-L10, CP-5 --
the canonical route (§41, §42): each module answers a vendor-validated Markdown
handoff for the host-owned subject `approve_run` pins, and the host anchors its
citations. Three calls, because a nightly job exists to prove the canonical
chain, not the catalog. `CAOS_LIVE_PROFILE` and `CAOS_LIVE_PATHWAY` name
another route on demand.

What is asserted is what the host can prove, never the model's wording: the run
finished, every pinned node was accepted with its host record, and the proof
re-derived every record and citation against the documents
(`server/qualification/proof.py`). It skips with its reason without a
credential, and `CAOS_REQUIRE_PROVIDER=1` turns the skip into a failure.
