"""The vendored bundle is the authority, and it is the one the spec was written
against.

Invariant 4: the bundle is the methodology authority, integrity checked on the
bytes. This is the pin -- every fact `docs/DECISIONS.md` §2 and §5 rest on,
asserted against the bytes in `vendor/`. A bundle swap that changes any of them
fails here rather than silently changing every route the system runs.

Verification at *use* is Phase 5. This is verification at rest: the vendored
copy is byte-identical to the manifest it shipped with.
