"""F06: a reservation is priced from the configured model, conservatively.

Each call's reservation covers that call: the bytes the provider will be sent
as input tokens -- a token is at least one byte, so the bound holds -- and the
output cap as output tokens (Task 8.2, §38). `worst_case`, the same arithmetic
at `MAX_REQUEST_BYTES`, stays as the run's admission check.
Runtime-driven cases run the canonical LITE route (Task 3.1 slice e-2).
