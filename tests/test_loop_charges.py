"""Phase 6 debt: the loop meets a real module and charges what was reported.

`docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md` lists `test_the_loop_charges_what_the_provider_reported`
under Phase 6, owed by Phase 4. Phase 4's loop reserved an estimate and charged
whatever its stub handed back; Phase 5 built the real module execution and the
real provider, which reports `usage.cost`. This is the join, on the canonical
LITE route (Task 3.1 slice f-1a): CP-0, CP-L10, CP-5.

The distinction the test exists for: an estimate is what the run set aside before
the call, and a charge is what the call cost. A ledger that recorded the estimate
would reconcile perfectly against itself and tell nobody what was spent.
