"""Positive end-to-end proofs for the LITE route (Task 3.4 brief, slice 3.4c).

Drives realistic, vendor-derived handoffs (`tests/lite_route_fixtures.py`)
through the real runtime -- `run_route` -> `ModuleProvider` -> the canonical
executor -> the vendor validators -> `assert_orchestration_proof` -> the
canonical deliverable -- rather than hand-building records the way
`tests/test_deliverable_canonical.py`'s `_accept` helper does. §45.6 and §46
are the read-model and named-object rules this slice proves in the round trip;
§39's "Restricted is usable but not QA-cleared" is proven for a route that
carries no CP-6 QA_GATE by showing nothing in the run, the proof or the
deliverable reports any clearance beyond CP-5's own stated `qa_status`.
