"""Record format v2: the delivered authority and the full upstream lineage
(Phase 3 Task 3.3 slice 3.3c; `docs/DECISIONS.md` §45.1, §45.4, §45.5).

A record binds exactly the authority files its prompt carried, and the whole
accepted chain behind its direct inputs -- each ancestor's (artifact, record)
pair, read from the stored records rather than recomputed from the prompt. A
reader re-derives both from the pinned bundle and the accepted rows, so an
ancestor whose record moved after its consumer was accepted refuses before
another call and at the proof. A non-gate node the pinned route gives no direct
CP-0 input refuses before any attempt.
