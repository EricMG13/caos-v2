"""Completion Phase 13.1: a wide frontier finishes in the longest node's time.

The plan writes this as `await gather(...)` and the ledger entry as "the `for`
becomes a `gather`". What it turns out to need first is a rule the spec does
not state: **which** ready nodes may run beside each other. The frontier offers
every node whose *blocking* inputs are met, and a soft edge does not block --
so the frontier can offer a node together with one of its own optional
upstreams, and `execute_handoff` refuses an attempt whose input was accepted
while its call was in flight. Running that pair together buys a billed attempt
that is thrown away, which is money spent with nobody choosing to spend it.

`independent_batch` is that rule, and it is pure: the same pinned route and the
same accepted set choose the same batch, so replay takes the same path
(invariant 10) even though the nodes overlap in time.
