"""Phase 1: bytes are content-addressed, and the address is checked on the way out.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` section 2: bytes live in a content-addressed blob store keyed by
`sha256`; the database holds the digest, never the bytes. That is a guarantee
only if the store re-derives the digest from what it is about to return. A store
that trusts its own filenames is a naming convention, and the citation chain of
invariant 11 rests on it being more than that.
