"""The argument-count suppressions are a budget, and a budget only falls (W11).

`# noqa: PLR0913` is the one lint suppression this tree hands out for width,
and each is a function whose parameter list nobody has yet found the type for.
What the budget counts is the *positional* ones: a caller can transpose two
neighbouring arguments of the same type silently, and that is the defect this
rule exists to keep a lid on. A suppressed function whose extra parameters are
keyword-only cannot be called wrongly that way, so it is recorded here and not
charged.

**The unit changed on 17 September 2026, by the owner's decision, and the old
one is stated here so nobody has to reconstruct it.** The budget used to count
raw markers, capped at 52. Integrating wave 3 of the audit remediation took
that count to 53: one marker left `server/methodology/canonical.py`, and two
arrived with functions that each replaced several copies of themselves -- the
shared verification reader, and the one governed envelope that five routes had
been spelling inline while a module-local helper served the rest. So the raw
count rose by one while the tree lost about 346 lines of duplication, because
the copies it removed were never suppressed and so had never been counted.
A ceiling that punishes concentrating a suppression into one shared helper is
measuring the
wrong thing, and raising it to 53 would have been a threshold moved to obtain
a pass. Two other units were measured and rejected before this one: counting
markers outside the shared helpers rose 47 -> 49, because consolidating
callers drains *other* helpers' caller counts and pushes them across the
threshold; and any unit over raw markers rises here by construction.

**The scan widened on 17 September 2026, at Completion Phase 12's confidence
review, and this is the seventh instance of the class `CLAUDE.md` names.** The
count above was over *marked* functions only -- the scan returned early unless
a file carried `noqa: PLR0913`, and skipped any function whose own line lacked
it. Its axis was therefore **marker presence**, not width. Ruff does not raise
`PLR0913` for a dummy-named (leading-underscore) parameter, and this layer's
own convention is to name an unused dependency `_standing` and an unused body
`_body` -- so a handler at seven positional parameters carried no marker, and a
gate keyed on the marker could not see it. Three of Completion Phase 12's own
handlers were exactly that shape, and the true count went 24 -> 27 while this
file read 22 -> 22. The cheapest evasion of the old rule was to drop the
marker, which makes the code no better and the gate blind; the cheapest evasion
of this one is to make the surplus keyword-only, which is the fix.

So the scan now reads **every** module-level function under the scanned roots
and charges on positional width whether or not a marker is present. The number
is 24, measured on 2026-09-17 at both `1b1ffcd` (the phase's base) and its
integrated head -- so the phase added none, once its three handlers were made
keyword-only. It is a wider measurement than the 22 above, not a raised
ceiling: the two numbers count different sets, and the old one is stated here
so nobody reads the change as a threshold moved to obtain a pass.

The criterion that picked this unit, stated once rather than three times: two
of the three units considered were gameable in the direction of making the
code *worse* -- the caller-count one rewarded the consolidation it meant to
punish, and a count of named parameters would have let `(a, b, *rest)` go from
charged to clear while becoming unbounded. This one is the one where gaming it
is the fix.

    """22 measured on 2026-09-17 over the integrated wave 3, unmoved from the
    wave's base. Lower this number when you narrow one; never raise it.

    A suppression is charged when the function takes more than five positional
    parameters -- ruff's own ceiling, counted the way a caller meets them.
    Making the surplus keyword-only clears the charge, which is not an evasion:
    that is the fix. Every suppression is still read, so a marker on a function
    that no longer needs one cannot hide behind the keyword rule.

    The 22 are not scattered, and that is the finding the number hides:
    eighteen are under `server/api/` -- the command handlers and the section
    reads -- at six to nine positional parameters, and twenty-one of the
    twenty-two declare no keyword-only parameter at all. The other four are
    the proof and deliverable constructors, `store/runs.py`'s `_transition`
    and `evidence/page.py`'s `_frame`. So the charge points at one
    architectural layer that takes its arguments positionally, and at a fix
    that layer could take.
