"""Phase 6: authority is checked where the commit is, and the audit chains.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §8 says commit time, and a check at the request is not that.
The distance between them is a real window: a request arrives, standing is
checked, work happens, the actor's membership is revoked, and the commit lands
anyway. So the check lives inside the store call that writes.

`SYSTEM_SPEC.md` §2's audit rule is the other half. A governed write commits its
state and its audit event in one transaction -- or neither. `audit_events` is
hash-chained per case under an `audit_chain_heads` lock row, so a rewrite is
detectable by comparing a retained head against the live one.

Two of the tests here are named in `docs/REBUILD_PLAN.md`: Phase 6's
`test_membership_revocation_refuses_commit`, and the Phase 1 debt Phase 6 owes,
`test_a_governed_write_commits_its_audit_event_or_nothing`.
