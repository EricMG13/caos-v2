"""The live qualification driver, checked where it decides not to spend --
and, separately, driven through its whole happy path against a real database.

The run this drives costs real money and is authorized one at a time, so what
is worth testing offline is the refusal before the spend: a profile the caller
did not expect must stop the driver before it creates a database, let alone
calls a provider. Everything after that point is "the harness's own, and has
its own suite" -- true of the behaviour, but SonarCloud's coverage gate is
per file, not per behaviour, and it does not credit this file for exercising
someone else's. So the happy path is driven here too, end to end, through
`qualify.main` exactly as an operator runs it: a real local PostgreSQL that
`qualify.py` creates and drops a database on (the same admin-connection
pattern `tests/conftest.py`'s `empty_database` uses), and a fake completion
provider standing in for OpenRouter so the run costs nothing and touches no
network.

The happy-path scenario below calls `qualify.main` with no `--attempts`, so
it exercises the single-`perform` path regardless of whether this revision's
`qualify.py` also carries `_perform_until`'s retry loop -- the default is one
attempt either way, and the retry loop has no suite of its own to lean on.
