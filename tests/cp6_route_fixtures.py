#### IC Debate Source Gate

Ready with Limitations: CP-0, CP-1, CP-2, CP-3, CP-5 and CP-3D are direct upstream; CP-4 is mediated through CP-3/CP-5; {downside_gate}; {liquidity_gate}; {refinancing_gate}. Stressed recovery remains evidence-bounded.

#### Pre-Debate Thesis Map

Strong audited cash flow, moderate liquidity and legal evidence, current but narrow relative-value evidence, and weak independent downside evidence make the central controversy whether {facts.spread_premium}bp compensates for delayed lender control.

#### Bull Analyst Opening Statement

**Claim 1 — cash flow.** Evidence: FY2025 FCF {facts.free_cash_flow}. Risk mechanic: retained cash services debt. Credit implication: Neutral — Stable. Monitoring signal: FCF below {facts.free_cash_flow}.

**Claim 2 — structure.** Evidence: {facts.net_leverage:.1f}x versus {facts.covenant_limit:.1f}x. Risk mechanic: headroom absorbs stress. Credit implication: Positive — Covenant Headroom Expansion. Monitoring signal: leverage above 3.0x.

**Claim 3 — relative value.** Evidence: {facts.loan_spread}bp versus {facts.peer_spread}bp. Risk mechanic: premium compensates limited uncertainty. Credit implication: Neutral — Stable. Monitoring signal: premium below {facts.spread_premium}bp.

#### Bear Analyst Cross-Examination

The exact three claims are challenged in T6A.4; the Zero-Bound path runs from {facts.downside_revenue_change}% revenue stress through EBITDA and FCF compression to higher leverage, delayed covenant control and refinancing risk.

#### Bull Analyst Defense

Claim 1 is Partially Rebutted by positive FCF; Claim 2 is Partially Rebutted by current headroom; Claim 3 is Partially Rebutted by dated pricing. No new claim is introduced.

#### IC Chair Evidence Weighting

All nine required dimensions are scored in T6A.6 without averaging away the downside evidence limitation.

#### Debate Resolution Matrix

T6A.7 resolves cash flow, legal control and relative value using the permitted labels.

#### Action Bias Determination

Final Action Bias: Starter Position. The decision is driven by positive FY2025 FCF and current spread premium, because retained cash and compensation absorb part of the identified stress, which implies stable debt service with constrained portfolio risk. The main factor preventing a higher-conviction recommendation is source-bounded downside evidence. Bull wins narrowly because cash flow is direct while the downside path remains constrained.

#### Single Greatest Uncertainty

The single uncertainty is independently adjudicated downside severity. It matters because a completed stress path could move the bias to Watchlist; evidence showing protected FCF supports Core Hold, while evidence showing covenant erosion supports Avoid.

#### IC Chair Final Memo

Decision: Starter Position. Bull wins narrowly on FCF; Bear's annual-test attack is strongest. Legal control is delayed, liquidity is positive but refinancing remains monitored, and the {facts.spread_premium}bp premium supports only limited sizing. Extend the pinned downside evidence before increasing conviction.

#### Gaps Ledger

All three grouped issuer gaps are recorded sequentially in T6A.11.

### CP-6A portfolio debate

#### Portfolio Debate Source Gate

Ready with Limitations: CP-3, current pricing, mandate and exposure inputs are available; {downside_gate}; {liquidity_gate}; {refinancing_gate}. Recovery and sizing remain evidence-bounded.

#### Pre-Debate Portfolio Thesis Map

Current pricing, downside, legal, concentration, mandate and liquidity evidence frame whether a {facts.spread_premium}bp premium compensates for the missing independent portfolio-fit adjudication.

#### The RV Trader's Pitch

**RV Bullet 1 — spread.** Evidence: {facts.loan_spread}bp versus {facts.peer_spread}bp. Risk mechanic: yield pickup. Credit implication: Neutral — Stable. Monitoring signal: premium compression.

**RV Bullet 2 — instrument.** Evidence: price {facts.loan_price} and senior secured status. Risk mechanic: discount and priority protect value. Credit implication: Neutral — Stable. Monitoring signal: legal-control erosion.

**RV Bullet 3 — implementation.** Evidence: {facts.pro_forma_exposure:.1f}% versus {facts.issuer_limit:.1f}% mandate limit. Risk mechanic: stated headroom limits concentration use. Credit implication: Neutral — Stable. Monitoring signal: exposure above {facts.pro_forma_exposure:.1f}%.

#### The Mandate Compliance Officer's Attack

The exact three bullets are challenged in T6E.4 against data-quality and legal/recovery constraints.

#### The RV Trader's Defense

Bullets 1 and 2 are Partially Rebutted by current pricing and executed terms; Bullet 3 is Partially Rebutted by mandate arithmetic, but no exact size is approved without complete portfolio analysis.

#### CIO Evidence Weighting

All nine allocation dimensions are scored in T6E.6, with the portfolio-analysis gap retained.

#### Allocation Decision Matrix

T6E.7 resolves peer compensation, concentration and implementation liquidity.

#### Final Sizing Posture

Final Sizing Posture: Requires More Work. The decision is driven by incomplete portfolio-fit evidence, because direct mandate arithmetic cannot test correlation and total risk-budget use, which implies no decision-useful final size. Requires More Work maps to Requires More Work. Neither persona wins because market evidence is current but portfolio-fit evidence is incomplete.

#### Exact Portfolio Constraint

Exact Portfolio Constraint: Data quality. Evidence: full-portfolio correlation effects are not quantified. Risk mechanic: untested correlation and risk-budget effects cap sizing. Credit / Portfolio Implication: no final allocation. Evidence Needed to Resolve: current analysis over the complete portfolio.

#### CIO Final Memo

Decision: Requires More Work, mapped unchanged. Neither persona wins. The {facts.spread_premium}bp premium is the best RV evidence; incomplete portfolio-fit evidence is the decisive Compliance attack. Legal control tests annually, liquidity supports a {facts.exit_days}-day exit, mandate headroom is arithmetically positive, and complete portfolio analysis is required before sizing.

#### Gaps Ledger

All four grouped portfolio gaps are recorded sequentially in T6E.11.
