"""The VMO2 deep-research qualification set is loadable, measurable and pinned.

No run is performed here -- the set's live run is Task 9.4 step 7 and needs the
owner's authorization. What is held is everything checkable without one: the
set loads through the `on_disk` loader the harness uses, measures something and
is unambiguous; its digest is the one `RESULT.md` records; its brief is one the
pin accepts on the pinned route and subject -- judged by the vendor's own
`validate_brief` and `Route`, `supplied_only` (invariant 1); every citation key
anchors exactly once in the real extractor's token index; and the one question
keyed UNRESOLVED names a fact neither document carries.
