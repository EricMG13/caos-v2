# The document register

Emitted 17 September 2026 against `codex/execute-repair-plan`, re-emitted after Task 9.1 added the portfolio-screen set's document copies, and again after Task 9.2 added the relative-value set and its two peer releases; Task 9.3's public decision-record stand-in was admitted and then removed on the owner's instruction, the same day; re-emitted on 18 September 2026 after §98 brought the Boeing and Ford 10-K texts into their own sets, and on 19 September 2026 for the Phase 2 route-local evidence inventory.

> **How this file is made.** The hand-authored half is
> [`documents.json`](documents.json) — the demand, the public location, the status,
> the note. The table below is emitted by `scripts/document_register.py --report`,
> which reads that file plus every `qualification/*/qualification.json` and
> computes each document's size and SHA-256 from the bytes on disk. Do not
> hand-edit the table: change `documents.json` and re-emit. The same script is a
> gate — it exits non-zero when a qualification set names a document the
> register does not list, and when a row claims `in_hand` for something that is
> not a file under `qualification/`.

Nothing here is fetched by the system. Invariant 1 makes web discovery
structurally absent, so every document arrives because the owner sourced it and
the coordinator admitted it. A `to_source` row is a request to a person.

## Why a register

When this register was created, twelve of the catalog's twenty-three modules
were proven and eleven were not (`docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` §2). All eighteen
routes are now deterministically enabled, but the evidence demands remain
independent of code coverage: CP-4 needs executed instruments, CP-2H needs
dated agency actions, CP-3D needs timestamped prices, and CP-8 needs a decision
that was actually taken. Those demands were read out of the vendored
`SKILL.md` files once. Without the register that reading is re-derived per task
and drifts; with it, one artefact holds the evidence boundary to the tree.

Each row's `demand_verified` says whether the module's own `SKILL.md` states a
document gate, or whether the demand is inferred from its purpose and register
names. Two rows are inferred; the note says from what.

## The register

<!-- emitted: register table. Everything between these markers is what
`scripts/document_register.py --report` prints; a test holds them equal, so
a row typed here is a row that fails. -->

<!-- /emitted -->

Forty-one documents: thirty `in_hand`, nine `to_source`, one `to_author`,
one `not_available`; plus one key source. Twenty-seven of the thirty-nine in hand are
set copies of the CCL 10-K, debt instruments, peer releases and VMO2 releases --
the route-local Phase 2 copies plus the earlier portfolio and deep-research sets --
which the on-disk loader requires because it refuses a declared path resolving outside its set root. One more, `cp-dr-research-brief`, is the
deep-research set's manifest: the brief is its `research_brief` object, so
the measured bytes are the whole manifest's. The two cruise peer releases
(`rcl-q4-2025-earnings`, `nclh-q4-2025-earnings`) replace the former
`cruise-peer-pack` row. The `bytes` and `sha256` columns are blank for a
document not in the tree: only a file under `qualification/` is measured, so
the table is the same on every machine.

## Sourcing list for the owner

Each row below is a document the programme needs and does not have in the tree.
No URL or accession number is asserted anywhere here: where one was not
verified, the venue and the identifier that *is* known are given instead, and
the register's `source` stays `null`. Inventing an accession would be worse
than leaving it blank, because a wrong one reads as provenance.

1. ~~**`ba-fy2025-10k`, `f-fy2025-10k` — copy in from the owner's document register.**~~
   Done on 18 September 2026 (§98): copied byte-for-byte into
   `qualification/ba-fy2025/documents/` and `qualification/f-fy2025/documents/`,
   digests verified on copy, under a large-file hook exclusion naming exactly
   those two paths. The original item:
   Both are already held, read-only, at
   `/Users/ericguei/Documents/Co-Pilot Agents/assessment_3issuer_20260719/corpus/`,
   with their raw HTML and SEC XBRL company facts in `raw/` beside them. This
   repository has not copied them. The coordinator admits each under its own
   digest (`0446b367…` and `97a38bc1…` as measured on 17 September 2026) and
   records the provenance in the receiving set's `RESULT.md` header. Neither
   fits the request ceiling; see **Size** below. The folder was renamed from
   `document register/` to `corpus/` after it was recorded; both digests were
   re-measured there on 18 September 2026 and are unchanged. They stay out of
   the tree until per-node evidence selection (§88.2, with the vendor) can run
   them: before that a copy frees no work, and at 1.1 and 1.8 MB each would
   need an exemption from the large-file hook.
2. **`ccl-debt-documents`, `ba-debt-documents` — executed debt documents.**
   Indentures, credit agreements and their maturity schedules, filed as
   exhibits on EDGAR. `docs/COMPLETION_PLAN.md` records the issuers' CIKs as
   **815097** (Carnival) and **12927** (Boeing); the exhibit and accession
   numbers were not established here, so the owner locates the exhibits by CIK
   and states the accession when admitting. CP-4's runbook step 1 is a Document
   Gate producing `T4F.1 Controlling Documents`, so a 10-K debt footnote does
   not substitute: CP-4 construes clause meaning and needs the instrument.
3. **`ccl-rating-actions` — dated agency rating actions and criteria.**
   CP-2H's Phase 1 wants dated issuer and instrument ratings, outlook and
   watch, recovery ratings where applicable, agency reports, issuer disclosures
   and the current criteria, with agency-issued evidence separated from
   management characterisation. Agency releases and criteria are
   entitlement-gated; an issuer's own disclosure of its ratings is the freely
   available substitute, and CP-2H is told to label it as the weaker evidence.
   This is a soft gate — without it CP-2H may do methodology-only work with
   limitations, so the module can be proven `Restricted` now and `Passed` only
   once this arrives.
4. **`ccl-market-data-extract` — a dated market-data extract.** Instrument
   identifiers, currency, coupon, maturity, seniority and pricing convention,
   and per observation the source, entitlement, bid/mid/ask or evaluated
   status, observation time and staleness. CP-3D states that required market
   observations cannot be replaced with model memory. This is the one demand no
   filing can satisfy: it is priced and timestamped rather than disclosed. The
   owner supplies it as a document; it is admitted under its own digest like any
   other.
5. ~~**`cruise-peer-pack` — the peers' own FY2025 filings.**~~ Sourced on 18
   September 2026 as `rcl-q4-2025-earnings` and `nclh-q4-2025-earnings` (Task
   9.2), by the coordinator under the owner's authorization "web search for
   equivalent versions to test": the other two listed major cruise operators'
   FY2025 earnings releases, as text extracts. The peer choice is the
   coordinator's recommendation applied under that instruction, not a peer set
   CP-1C derived; the owner may replace it. CP-1C's steps 0 and 1 are a Peer
   Discovery Gate and a Peer Data Gate, so each peer figure it benchmarks has
   to be citable -- which is why each release is admitted whole rather than
   summarised into a table.
6. **`ccl-decision-record` — an owner-authored decision record (to author).**
   CP-8 is explicit: *"Blocked: No decision record available to attribute.
   STOP — do not reconstruct a thesis after the fact."* So it must be a real,
   dated record from before the outcome window. A public rating-action news
   report was admitted as a stand-in on 18 September 2026 and removed the same
   day on the owner's instruction not to include the third-party excerpt;
   `LITE_DECISION_LEDGER` stays enabled on its contract and route tests, and
   has no qualification set until a memo exists.
7. **`cp-dr-research-brief` — an implementer-authored research brief (in
   hand, unconfirmed).** Materialized from
   `vendor/deploy-v/skills/cp-os-credit-os/references/CP_DR_RESEARCH_BRIEF_V1.md`
   by the Task 9.4 implementer for the VMO2 releases, in place of an
   owner-authored one: the owner asked for equivalent versions to test with and
   the coordinator recommended authoring, because a brief is a run control the
   host pins rather than evidence. It declares `supplied_only`, which the pin
   now requires (invariant 1: CP-DR's capability gate blocks `web_only` and
   `hybrid` when web research is unavailable, and here that is structural). Its
   three questions -- two the Q4 release answers, one neither release can --
   and the figures their keys name await the owner's confirmation
   (`qualification/vmo2-fy2025-deep-research/RESULT.md`).
8. **`distressed-disclosure-statement` — not available.** CP-4C's Phase 1
   distress gate needs evidence of payment or default risk, a failed
   refinancing, a distressed exchange or LME escalation, a covenant or
   enforcement event, adviser engagement, a filing, or another named distress
   trigger, and returns `Not Applicable` rather than a speculative
   restructuring when none is met. No issuer in the document register is distressed, so
   over this document register only CP-4C's `Not Applicable` path can be proven. Proving
   the substantive path means choosing a different issuer — a document register decision
   for the owner, not a fetch.

## Size

`MAX_REQUEST_BYTES` is **1,048,576** (`server/provider.py`), and it bounds the
*whole encoded request* — model, parameters, the module's delivered authority
files, every upstream record, and the evidence — not the document alone. So a
document comfortably under the ceiling can still put a wide route's prompt over
it, and `CONTEXT_OVER_CEILING` refuses before any attempt, reservation or call.

The `bytes` column is the document's own bytes on disk. For the two PDFs that
is the file, which overstates what reaches a prompt: the pinned extractor
yields 38,360 bytes of text from the Q3 release and 51,942 from Q4 (measured
with the vendored pdfminer). For the `.txt` extracts the file *is* the text.

| Document | Bytes reaching a prompt | Fits alone |
|---|---|---|
| `vmo2-q3-2025-earnings` | 38,360 (extracted text) | yes, with ample room |
| `vmo2-q4-2025-earnings` | 51,942 (extracted text) | yes, with ample room |
| `ccl-fy2025-10k` | 311,896 | yes — 30% of the ceiling |
| `ba-fy2025-10k` | 905,758 of block text (1,177,234 on disk) | **no** — whole, with CP-0's authority, past the ceiling |
| `f-fy2025-10k` | 1,435,471 of block text (1,922,743 on disk) | **no** — 137% of the ceiling in text alone |

Which pathway tasks may run before per-node evidence selection exists:

- **VMO2 (two releases, ~90 KB of text together)** — any pathway whose nodes
  are served by earnings releases. The LITE earnings route already has a
  complete live snapshot here.
- **CCL (312 KB)** — runnable whole today, with roughly 700 KB left for
  authority files and upstream records. That headroom shrinks with every node
  on the route, so the long routes (`FULL_CREDIT_ASSESSMENT`'s 19 nodes) are
  the ones to measure rather than assume.
- **BA and F** — not runnable whole, and since §98 runnable by page. The gate
  is shown each as its page map (the leading lines of every fixed-pitch page:
  16 of 108 pages' lines for BA, 10 of 146 for F, measured), and names in T8
  the pages each consumer is handed. Measured on the LITE earnings route: the
  gate's whole request, and a consumer handed the statements' pages, both fit
  the ceiling (`tests/test_large_documents.py`); the whole document named
  whole still refuses `CONTEXT_OVER_CEILING`, as it must. None of this has met
  a live model: whether a real CP-0 names useful pages from a map of a page's
  first lines is unmeasured.

## The key source

`ANSWER_KEY_3ISSUER.md` (8,268 bytes, as of 19 July 2026) holds the owner's
independent reading of the three 10-Ks: core facts, derived values and 24 traps
per issuer. It is a **key source** — a qualification set's `expects` rows may
be authored from it — and it is **never an admitted document**. Admitting it
would put the answers inside the evidence the modules read, and a key measured
against a document register that contains the key measures nothing. It has no row in the
documents table for exactly that reason; the script emits it in its own line,
labelled.

One thing it cannot do: `ExpectedCitation` is
`(module_id, document_sha256, matched_text)`, so a key's derived values and
traps become citation expectations, not value comparisons. The known-gaps
ledger entry "An answer key names citations, not figures" is the standing
statement of that limit, and it applies to every key authored from this
document.
