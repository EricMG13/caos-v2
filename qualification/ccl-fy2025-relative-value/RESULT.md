# CCL FY2025 relative-value screen qualification — no run has been performed

**No run has been performed against this set.** It is authored, loadable and
digested; nothing here reports a result, a verdict or a provider. The live run
is Phase 9 Task 9.2 step 7 and needs the owner's explicit authorization — it
costs real money and calls a real model.

## The set

- Qualification-set digest:
  `a8df0ccf6d8fd735886c584951f7ca82e460f483a4f235a5ad31143fd3f60ac8`
- Route: `LITE_CREDIT_22 / LITE_RELATIVE_VALUE` (`CP-0` → `CP-L10` → `CP-1C`,
  three REQUIRED edges, `decision_scope: SCREENING_ONLY`). CP-1C is a FULL
  module held behind the named-LITE-object boundary until CP-L10's
  `lite_financial_change_screen` is accepted (§46.1); the offline contract is
  `tests/test_lite_relative_value_route.py` and
  `tests/test_lite_cp1c_contract.py`.
- Documents:
  - `CCL_FY2025_10K.txt` — the Carnival Corporation & plc FY2025 Form 10-K text
    extract, the same bytes as `qualification/ccl-fy2025/`
    (`8fa7fceda34be50b3b9b5406e0c9269b5269870d1cd8c2bdafb682755a1c88e6`),
    copied because `server/qualification/on_disk._document` refuses a declared
    path outside the set's own directory.

## Where the peer documents came from

The two peer releases were sourced by the coordinator on 18 September 2026
under the owner's authorization "web search for equivalent versions to test".
**The peer choice — RCL and NCLH, the other two listed major cruise operators
— is the coordinator's recommendation applied under that instruction**, not a
peer set the owner named and not one CP-1C derived; CP-1C's own Peer Discovery
Gate may judge it differently, and the owner may replace it. Both files are
HTML-to-text conversions made by the coordinator, so for these two documents
the file *is* the text: no issuer typography, page layout or table geometry
survives, and a table's cells arrive one per line. Both digests were verified
after copying into the set.

## Keys, and where each came from

**Keys authored by the implementer from the documents; material figures
pending owner confirmation.** Nothing has been run on this route, so there was
no output to copy from. Every quote below was checked against the real
plain-text extractor's token index: each matches whole tokens and matches
**once**, on one page, so it anchors rather than refusing
`CITATION_AMBIGUOUS`.

- `expects_ready: ["CP-L10", "CP-1C"]` — the route's two pinned consumers,
  which is what CP-0's T8 is asked to report.
- `expects_projection` — `decision_scope` = `SCREENING_ONLY` for CP-L10 and
  CP-1C, the catalog pathway's scope, which the host projects and the bundle
  now enforces against `Committee Ready` (§92).
- `expects` (citations):
  - CP-L10, 10-K page 11: the liquidity sentence ("As of November 30, 2025, we
    had $6.4 billion of liquidity …"), the fact the LIQUIDITY_MATURITIES topic
    turns on.
  - CP-1C, 10-K page 17: `Total Debt, net of unamortized debt issuance costs
    and discounts | 26,640 | 27,475 |` — the balance-sheet carrying value
    CP-1C's canon rule 5 names as the debt figure (not the 27,383 face total
    two lines above it).
  - CP-1C, NCLH page 1: "Total Debt was $14.6 billion. Net Debt was $14.4
    billion. Net Leverage was 5.3x at December 31, 2025."
  - CP-1C, RCL page 1: the full-year headline sentence ending "and Adjusted
    EBITDA was $7.0 billion."
- `expects_register`:
  - CP-L10 `TL10.2`, row `topic_id = LIQUIDITY_MATURITIES`, `evidence_status`
    = `SUFFICIENT`. Read from the 10-K: the liquidity sentence above, the
    $4.5 billion Revolving Facility, and a scheduled debt-maturity table
    (page 17, "As of November 30, 2025, the scheduled maturities of our debt
    are as follows:"). This is the register key the portfolio-screen set
    recorded as owed "with the reading"; this is that reading, for this set.
  - CP-1C `T4.5`, row `Entity = Carnival Corporation & plc`,
    `Total/Net/Sr Sec Leverage` = `[Calculated] 3.66x / 3.40x`. Debt 26,640
    (2,603 current + 24,037 long-term, carrying value); cash 1,928; EBITDA is
    not reported in the 10-K, so it is derived as operating income 4,483 + D&A
    2,790 = 7,273. Gross 26,640 / 7,273 = 3.66x; net 24,712 / 7,273 = 3.40x.
    The same figures stand in the owner's key source
    (`ANSWER_KEY_3ISSUER.md`, CCL core facts), which was read to confirm them,
    not admitted.
  - CP-1C `T4.5`, row `Entity = Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd.`,
    `Total/Net/Sr Sec Leverage` = `[Calculated] 5.35x / 5.3x (reported)`.
    Total debt 14,606,176 and Adjusted EBITDA 2,730,226 (thousands, the
    release's Net Leverage reconciliation) give a calculated 5.35x gross; the
    5.3x net is the issuer's own reported Net Leverage.

What the register keys cost, stated so a miss is read rather than counted:
the matrix compares a cell **exactly** (whitespace- and NFC-normalised, case
kept), and both the `Entity` row key and the leverage cell are free text a
module may spell differently while being right — `Carnival Corporation`,
`3.7x`, a senior-secured leg, or no `[Calculated]` label. The spellings above
are the implementer's; the owner may restate them before the run, which moves
the digest. RCL is cited but carries no register key: its release gives debt
(3,180 current + 18,165 long-term = 21,345) and Adjusted EBITDA 7,025, so
`[Calculated]` 3.04x gross, but a third free-text key adds a third chance to
miss for spelling rather than substance.

Two comparability traps a sound CP-1C should name rather than blend: CCL's
fiscal year ends 30 November 2025 and both peers' 31 December 2025; and the
peers' leverage denominators are their own **Adjusted** EBITDA while CCL's is
derived from operating income plus D&A.

## What is owed

- The owner's confirmation of the material figures and of the key spellings.
- **The run itself** (step 7, authorization required), and a signed verdict or
  a recorded reason why not.
